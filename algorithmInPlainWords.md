### Bubble sort<br>
>It simply walk through the arrey, and once it sees a number out of order compared to the next one, it swaps both of 'em. Suppose we have an arrey that has N numbers in it. It takes N times of swaps to finish an iteration. And it at most takes (N+1) iterations to finish sort the arrey. So its big O is n^2.
