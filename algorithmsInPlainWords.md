# Algorithms in Plain English and JavaScript<br>
### Bubble sort<br>
>It simply walk through the arrey, and once it sees a number out of order compared to the next one, it swaps both of 'em. Suppose we have an arrey that has N numbers in it. It takes N times of swaps to finish an iteration. And it at most takes N iterations to finish sort the arrey. So its big O is n^2.
#### Here is how it's done in js:
```js
let bubbleSort = (nums) => {
  for (var j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) { //Walk the arrey through for N times. 
    for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) { //Walk through all N elements of the arrey.
      let x;
      if (nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) {
        x = nums[i]; //Put a variable as a value container while exchanging.
        nums[i] = nums[i + 1];
        nums[i + 1] = x;
      }
    }
  }
}
```
#### Rossetta Code version:
```js
Array.prototype.bubblesort = function() {
    var done = false;
    while (!done) {
        done = true;
        for (var i = 1; i<this.length; i++) {
            if (this[i-1] > this[i]) {
                done = false;
 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â [this[i-1], this[i]] = [this[i], this[i-1]]//Nasty as fuckðŸ’€!
            }
        }
    }
    return this;
}
```
